# Quote-Generator

## Description:
**Quote Generator** is a small web application that generates a random quote, everytime you *click* on "**New Quote**" button. It has a beautiful **gradient styling** which looks good to the eye.

### Technologies Used:
1) JavaScript.
2) CSS.
3) HTML.
***
**Brief:** In this project, I have used an **array of quotes**, and then used a **function** that takes a random quote from the array using **math.randon** function. And finally added **event listeners** to respond on click.

#### What Next?
Instead on an array of quotes, I am planning to use **API's** for generation of quotes and **fetching** the data in the application.

#### How to contribute?

_I love building things, it does not matter whether the application is small or huge. So if you are new to this technology and eager to learn, we can go ahead and develop more features in the application._
